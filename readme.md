# 🧪 Node TSX API — Late Night Shenanigans 🌙⚡

A late-night experiment where a simple “lemme test something real quick”  
turned into a full-blown Node + TypeScript + TSX server sprinting for its life.

Does this project solve any real-world problems?  
Absolutely not.  
Does it run?  
Also absolutely not—  
it **sprints**.

## 🐎 Server Status

The server is currently **running for its f***ing life** at:

http://localhost:3001



If it stops, it dies. Classic backend cardio.  
It has already clocked in **400 meters of elevation gain** and is begging for electrolytes.

## 📦 Tech Stack (a.k.a. The Midnight Buffet)

- 🟦 **TypeScript** — because writing bugs without types felt too easy  
- 🧩 **TSX** — like ts-node, but actually loves you  
- ⚙️ **Express (v4)** — not v5, because we enjoy sanity  
- 🧠 **ESM imports** — CommonJS is now considered retro  
- 🔥 **Node** — obviously, this is still a server not a salad

---

## 💡 Features (calling them “features” is generous)

- A server that boots up  
- API routes that return something (miraculous)  
- In-memory “database” powered by pure cope  
- Hot reload so you can break things twice as fast  
- Fully typed, until you get lazy and cast everything to `any`

## 🗂 File Structure (minimal, like my motivation before caffeine)

/
├── server.ts # All the chaos lives here
├── package.json # The lies we tell npm
├── tsconfig.json # Exists purely so TS stops yelling
└── README.md # Your current location



---

## 🚀 Running the Server

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
Start dev mode (with live reload):

bash
npm run dev
Start production mode (if you hate yourself):

bash
npm start
At this point, the server begins sprinting uphill like it owes someone money.

📡 API Routes
GET /users
json

[
  { "id": 1, "name": "Bear" }
]
POST /users
Adds a new user to the RAM-powered “database.”
It will vanish the moment you close the terminal, sneeze, or enter sleep mode.

🤝 Contributing
Contributions welcome.
But also… why?
No idea.
Send PR anyway.
I’ll merge it while laughing.
